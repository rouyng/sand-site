SAND is an independent curatorial project in Phoenix, Arizona, begun in 2018 by Justen Waterhouse and Ross Young. SAND is a vessel for organizing and facilitating art exhibitions, public conversations, and film screenings. We are motivated by the desire to foster alternative modes of art production and discourse within the Phoenix community.

By hosting exchanges between the local community and arts practitioners from other contexts, SAND seeks to form new solidarities and germinate other alternative spaces within the Phoenix art community.
