SAND is an independent curatorial project in Phoenix, Arizona, begun in 2018 by `Justen Waterhouse <http://www.justenwaterhouse.com>`_ and `Ross Young <http://www.r-c-y.net>`_. SAND is a vessel for organizing and facilitating art exhibitions, public conversations, and film screenings. We are motivated by the desire to foster alternative modes of art production and discourse within the Phoenix community.

By hosting exchanges between the local community and arts practitioners from other contexts, SAND seeks to form new solidarities and germinate other alternative spaces within the Phoenix art community.

SAND is noncommercial and currently funded primarily out of our own pockets.  We have day jobs and make SAND happen with the time and money left over from life's demands. SAND relies on our close-knit but geographically dispersed community, donations, and the support of friends to realize its programming. Support this project by subscribing on `Patreon <https://www.patreon.com/sandzone>`_, a one time donation through `Venmo <https://venmo.com/Justen-Waterhouse>`_, or in any other way you are able.
