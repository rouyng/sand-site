Summary: Support SAND in Phoenix.

SAND is a noncommercial project bringing alternative contemporary art to Phoenix. It is currently funded primarily out of our own pockets. We have day jobs and make SAND happen with the time and money left over from life's demands. We need your support in order to provide artists, writers, and other collaborators with travel stipends/compensation for their work, to transport and fabricate artworks, as well as install exhibitions. SAND relies on its close-knit but geographically dispersed community, donations, and the support of friends to realize its programming.
