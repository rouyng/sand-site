Summary: SAND is sending out a selection of prints and texts by invited friends, artists, designers and other creative practitioners to anyone who wants to receive mail. Round 3 is in progress.

In May 2020, during widespread disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began SAND Mail as a way to continue building connections. SAND Mail is for friends who want to send or receive mail. SAND is sending out a selection of prints and texts by invited friends, artists, designers and other creative practitioners to anyone who wants to receive mail. We ship to both domestic and international addresses. SAND Mail operates in monthly roundsâ€” each round has a unique list of contributors. These contributions are printed by SAND and packaged together in a small envelope. All recipients receive one of these envelopes, which contain editions of all the contributions for that round.
