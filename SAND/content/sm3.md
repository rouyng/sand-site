Summary: SAND is sending out a selection of prints and texts by invited friends, artists, designers and other creative practitioners to anyone who wants to receive mail. Round 3 is in progress.

In May 2020, during widespread disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we began SAND Mail as a way to continue building connections. SAND Mail is for friends who want to send or receive mail. SAND is sending out a selection of prints and texts by invited friends, artists, designers and other creative practitioners to anyone who wants to receive mail. We ship to both domestic and international addresses. SAND Mail operates in monthly rounds— each round has a unique list of contributors. These contributions are printed by SAND and packaged together in a small envelope. All recipients receive one of these envelopes, which contain editions of all the contributions for that round.

**Round 3 is currently in progress and the recipient list is open until July 2, 2020.**

SAND Mail began as an ad hoc project to both receive and send mail to our friends. By Round 3, we are sending mail out to 60+ addresses. We are very happy to be able to send mail to so many of you. In order to keep up with printing and postage costs, we are introducing a new system for receiving mail. 

**There are three ways to receive SAND mail. We send mail to both US-based and international addresses and these options are the same for both:**

- [Subscribe to our $3/month “SAND Mail” Patreon tier](https://www.patreon.com/sandzone) to receive all future rounds of SAND Mail. Send us a message through Patreon or email us with your mailing address once you have pledged. Your Patreon contribution pays for the printing and postage cost of your mail. Unfortunately, we cannot send rounds from the back catalogue. 
- [Email](mailto:info@sand.zone) or [DM](https://www.instagram.com/sand.zone/) us your address to be placed on the lottery list. Each round, we draw 10 addresses randomly from the lottery list to determine who will receive SAND Mail. This is free of charge- if your name/address is selected you will receive a SAND Mail envelope at no cost to you. Your name will remain on the lottery list for subsequent rounds unless you notify us that you would like it removed. 
- All invited contributors will receive any rounds of SAND Mail in which their work appears free of charge, and will receive extra envelopes for their friends/family/archives.
