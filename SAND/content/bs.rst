To most of our wild birds, humans must appear as eccentric and contradictory. By turns humans are hostile, indifferent, friendly towards them, so that they never quite know what to expect. Birds are able sometimes to discriminate between protectors and persecutors, but seldom very well, we should imagine. Regardless, we know two or three persons who are as fond of the bird as we are; and two or three recent writers on birds have spoken of its song as if they loved it.
