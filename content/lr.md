## [Press Release](/files/QRVPressRelease.pdf)

![Lisa Radon press image](/img/lr/radon-pr.jpg)

*How we find each other in the dark. How we know and are known to one another. How we are resourceful, have been resourceful, of necessity. How we improvise, are plastic.*   

*An octopus can slip through any hole larger than its beak.*  

*How we project into futures. How we, at least, do not forget. And we do not go alone.*  

*We carry with us what we need.*  

*We find what we need wherever we are.*  

QRV is a Q-signal or radio shorthand that means, "I am ready. Are you ready?"
