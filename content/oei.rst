:summary: OEI launches issue #82-83, including an essay by SAND

We are proud to announce the inclusion of an essay by SAND in the most recent issue of `OEI  <http://www.oei.nu/w/1.html>`_, a Stockholm-based magazine for "extra-disciplinary spaces and de-disciplinizing moments." OEI was founded in 1999 and is run by Jonas (J) Magnusson & Cecilia Grönberg.

*OEI #82–83: Art in the Age of Kleptomania* was edited by `Aeron Bergman and Alejandra Salinas <http://www.alejandra-aeron.com/>`_ and contains essays, artworks, and archival materials by twenty one artists, theorists, writers, and artist run spaces (mostly from the Americas). The subject of the issue is art and neoliberalism, and contains essays, images and other works by Dorothée Dupuis, Max Jorge Hindered Cruz, Luciano Concheiro, Yvonne Osei, Diego Bruno, John Riepenhoff, Suhail Malik, Good Weather, The Luminary, Bikini Wax, Beta-Local and more.

SAND's contribution to this issue is an essay on Phoenix, Arizona, including observations on the existing practices of showing art here, the influence of our desert urban landscape, and the relevant social and political histories that shape the city. We discuss our plans and intentions for SAND as an intervention into this context.

`You can read the full essay by downloading this PDF <../files/SAND\ in\ AZ.pdf>`_.
