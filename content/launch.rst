This post marks the official launch of SAND's website. Thank you for joining us.

We built SAND's website using `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com>`_, a free, open source static site generator written in Python. The theme is based on `martin-pelican <https://github.com/cpaulik/martin-pelican/>`_, originally created by Alison House and Christoph Paulik.
